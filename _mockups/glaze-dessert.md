Glaze Dessert is a donut shop just to crave your happiness in a box!

We, in a group of 4, Charlie, Nikko, Paul, and me were tasked to create a website for a fictional donut shop on our project for my school.
We were given a list of requirements and we had to follow them. We were also given a list of colors to use and we had to follow them as well.
